kb articles are like flash cards that can always be improved, or can always be 'tested' for correctness.
Doing so interactively is a great way to learn for the user and the kb and the bot. The bot can 'learn' the kb on its own and compile 'digests' for user-approval in-bulk, as-opposed to piecemeal flash card approval.
