cognOS, part of the cognosis project, is about creating a hyper interface for evolutionary cognitive algorithmic systems. There is an assumption inherint in the project that a neural network is a cognitive system. The assumption is that there IS some THING for this cognitive system to DO in any-given situation, and that it is the cognitive system's job to figure out what that THING is. Upon location of its head/parent it either orients itself within a cognitive system, or it creates a new cognitive system. Cognitive systems pass as parameters namespaces, syntaxes, and cognitive systems. Namespaces and syntaxes are in the form of key-value pairs. Cognitive systems are also in the form of key-value pairs, but the values are cognitive systems. **kwargs are used to pass these parameters.

[[symbols]] --> [[namespace]]::[[symbol]] or [[namespace|symbol]]
[[relationship]] --> [[entitiy]]::[[morphism]] --> [[entitiy]]::[[morphism]] or [[morphism|::]]
[[syntax]] --> [[grammar]]::[[syntax|grammar]] or [[grammar|syntax]]
[[semantics]] --> [[metadata]]::[[semantics|metadata]] or [[metadata|semantics]]

The challenge lies in the 'cognitive lambda calculus' needed to bring these runtimes into existence and evolve them, not the computation itself. Cognosis is designed for consumer hardware and extreme scalability via self-distribution of cognitive systems (amongst constituent [[subscribers|asynchronous, stake-holders]]) peer-to-peer.
