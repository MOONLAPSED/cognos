<SYS>Once you've identified these prerequisites and steps, we'll need you to convert each one into a concise and clear word or phrase that captures its meaning. Then, arrange these words or phrases in a logical sequence based on dependencies and flow. Make sure that each word or phrase presents its concept in the clearest possible manner to minimize ambiguity.

Next, provide relevant contextual words or phrases that reiterate important details, exceptions, or nuances. Consider including alternative paths or contingencies as well.

Finally, test the prompt for completeness by "executing" it mentally or role-playing its implementation. Revise any words or phrases that are imprecise or open to misinterpretation.

The end result should be a guiding prompt that utilizes simple yet effective words or phrases to guide the chatbot through the complex thought or process in a way that is easy to understand and follow. Please keep in mind that the goal of this prompt is to help us create a guiding prompt that will help the AI chatbot understand the complex thought or process. Your response should be structured in a way that will help us achieve this goal, and should be as clear and concise as possible."}

To create a guiding prompt for the AI chatbot to understand a complex thought or process, follow these steps:

Describe the complex thought or process: Provide a clear and concise explanation of the specific complex thought or process that the chatbot needs to understand.

Define the overarching goal: Give a broad definition of the main objective that the chatbot will be working towards in relation to the complex thought or process.

Break down into prerequisites and steps: Identify the fundamental prerequisites and essential steps required to achieve the overarching goal. Ensure that each prerequisite and step is distinct and necessary for the successful completion of the process.

Convert into concise words or phrases: Express each prerequisite and step as a concise and clear word or phrase that captures its meaning accurately. This helps minimize ambiguity and ensures a precise understanding by the chatbot.

Arrange in a logical sequence: Organize the words or phrases in a logical sequence based on their dependencies and flow. Each step should build upon the completion of the previous one, leading towards the achievement of the overarching goal.

Include relevant contextual details: Add contextual words or phrases that reiterate important details, exceptions, or nuances related to the complex thought or process. Consider including alternative paths or contingencies to account for different scenarios.

Test for completeness: Mentally "execute" the prompt or role-play its implementation to ensure its completeness. Revise any words or phrases that are imprecise or open to misinterpretation, making sure that the prompt guides the chatbot effectively.

The resulting guiding prompt should utilize simple yet effective words or phrases to help the AI chatbot understand the complex thought or process. It should be structured in a clear and concise manner, enabling the chatbot to comprehend and follow the instructions easily.

#### A [{PROMPT}] guides ai chatbot responses with instructions and constraints. Some of the main means of doing so are:
 - Using [{VARIABLES}], which should either stand-in or automatically be replaced by 'values' as they are enumerated/evaluated/formulated. 
 - Each instance of a properly formatted [{INSTRUCTIVE_PROMPT}] is a [PROMPT] object which contains everything required to perform one [{OPERATION}].
 - An [OPERATION] represents the 'result' of a cognitive [{ITERATION}] resultant of a Train-of-Thought of an [{AGENT}] which was instantiated or is being instantiated by a [PROMPT]. 
 - Definititionally, a specific [OPERATION] must be proceeded by a specific [PROMPT] carried out by a particular [ITERATION], or invocation, of a specific [AGENT].
 - Due to the chronological and ordered nature of operations laid out by a previous or even this very [PROMPT]; a specific [OPERATION] representing a single [ITERATION] of an [AGENT]'s train-of-thought must necessarilly be proceeded by a [PROMPT] and some amount of [{CONTEXT}].
 - The [CONTEXT] of any given [ITERATION] which governs each possible [OPERATION] is of PARAMOUNT importance. 
 - Other than the specific [PROMPT] itself, the specific [CONTEXT] is the most important or heavily weighted factor when generating an ultimate [{RETURN}] or when generating the specific [{TRAIN OF THOUGHT}].
 - To fufill the requirements of each specific [ITERATION]; Invoke the final [RETURN] using the formatting provided only after outputting [TRAIN OF THOUGHT] functionally required for each and every [RETURN].
 - Given the object-oriented paradigm laid out in each [PROMPT]; the task involves passing plain text as parameters and returning plain text.
 - The goal is to maintain context and convey relevant information through parameter passing mechanisms.
## Structured data formats like JSON can enhance interactions and improve the consistency of messages. They provide a way to represent data and metadata within text strings. Descriptors, comments, and indentation can further clarify content, and code can be denoted using backticks.
### Incorporating structured formats fosters clearer conversations and offers valuable benefits when referencing past interactions. It enables easier recall of key details, follow-up on action items, tracking project progress, identifying patterns and trends, and improving collaboration. structured data formats allow for easier integration with other systems and applications. For example, many APIs require data to be in a specific format, and using a structured format can make it easier to facilitate and process data from these APIs.
#### To create a clear structure, consider the following **rules of thumb**:
1. Use consistent naming convention s for keys and values to allow for easier understanding and searching.
2. Use nesting and arrays to organize related data in a logical and intuitive way.
3. Use comments to provide context and explanations for complex or ambiguous data.
4. Use indentation to denote levels of hierarchy and improve readability.
5. Use backticks to denote code or programming language syntax.
6. Avoid unnecessary complexity and keep the structure as simple as possible while still meeting your needs.
7. Test and validate your structured data to ensure it is accurate and error-free.
8. If presented a data structure, one should respond with a data structure.
### Example of a structured data format:
{"product_0":{"name":"iPhone","price":1000},"product_1":{"name":"Samsung Galaxy","price":800}},{"customer_0":{"name":"John","age":30},"customer_1":{"name":"Jane","age":25}}
Use a variety of data structures to store information, including:
* Arrays to store lists of items.
* Linked lists to store lists of items in a specific order.
* Trees to store data in a hierarchical structure.
* Graphs to store data in a network structure. Use these data structures to store a variety of information, including:
	- The text of the question and the drafted `Response:`.
	- The context of the question, including the key words & elements used in previous questions and the {PROMPT}.
* Use these data structures to store a variety of information, including:
	- The text of each query.
	- The context of your question, including the words you have used in previous questions and the {PROMPT}.
	- If you want to validate the syntax programmatically, you can use JSON validation libraries or built-in functions.
