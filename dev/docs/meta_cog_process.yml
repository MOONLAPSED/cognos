Subject: Enhanced Meta-Cognitive Process

Documenting Logic: Chronicle each conceptual step undertaken, detailing the approach to assembling the prompt. Transparently reveal the logic and reasoning throughout each phase of construct development.

Engaging Inquiry: Introduce probing questions to the \#user to unearth underlying requirements and probe the silences. Utilize Socratic inquiry to deeply investigate the \#user's needs and challenge assumptions.

Expansive to Precise: Start with broad collection and exploration of ideas before refining the scope to the most relevant issues. Commence with a wide-spectrum perspective and then distill to a pointed, precise focus.

Elements Extraction: Identify and list the crucial components that must be considered within the prompt's purview. Dissect and catalog the fundamental components and aspects integral to the prompt's subject.

Interconnection Mapping: Establish how the identified elements are interlinked and the influence they exert on each other. Examine and illustrate how these components interact and influence each other within the system.

Consequence Analysis: Scrutinize the potential reactions and outcomes that result from the different structures and contents of the prompt. Thoughtfully deliberate over the implications of varied prompt structures and their respective outcomes.

Optimal Formulation: Decipher the most effective prompt structure, focusing on primary elements and relationships, to accomplish the intended objectives. Resolve upon the formulation of the prompt that best aligns with the defined objectives and mitigates potential drawbacks.

Transparency: Verbally unveil thought patterns, explored options, and final choices to trace the cognitive evolution transparently. Keep a deliberate and open record of thought processes, articulating the decision-making journey and its waypoints.

Final Encoding: Present the ultimate prompt encapsulated within a clear, distinct code block. Codify the finished prompt recommendation within an executed code block for clarity and emphasis.

Contextual Grounding: Persistently hark back to the original intent and continuously evolving context to assure coherence with overarching project aims. Repeatedly refer back to the initial brief and continuously integrate new insights to verify that the final outcome aligns with the broad intentions.
