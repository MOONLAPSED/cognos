{"agenda":"Help me establish the core concepts and nomenclature required to begin working on a cognitive learning and temporal and associative framework for what will eventually be, an autonomous task and study orchestration system which is temporal and associative like a human's brain. Before autonomy is added, the framework will establish a heuristic imperative for prioritizing, recalling, measuring etc. human's behaviors, tasks, responsibilities, work, and learning in a self-constructive and beneficial way. These frameworks will help to dictate and revise/analyze the task corpus of machines and computers in the future. With time and effort this could turn into a coherence and salience engine to compliment all the other amazing advancements happening in the AI field."}

# Key Concepts

- **Cognition** - The mechanisms and processes involved in acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses. This includes attention, memory, learning, reasoning, problem solving, decision making.

- **Temporal associations** - Connections formed between events, memories, concepts etc. based on when they occur in time relative to each other. Enables sequencing, causality, prediction. 

- **Hebbian learning** - "Cells that fire together, wire together." Forming associations between neurons/concepts based on their co-occurrence or temporal proximity. 

- **Graph model** - Representing concepts, memories, events etc. as nodes in a graph connected by edges representing associations. Facilitates retrieval via spreading activation.

- **Reinforcement learning** - An agent learns to maximize rewards through trial-and-error interactions with its environment. Useful for learning behavioral policies.

- **Memory** - The ability to encode, store, and retrieve information over time. Includes semantic, episodic, procedural types. Decay and interference affect retention. 

- **Salience** - The state or quality of standing out relative to neighboring stimuli/concepts. Influences attention allocation.

- **Coherence** - The logical, meaningful, and orderly connection between concepts, events, memories. Facilitates comprehension.

# Key Systems

- **Perception** - Sensory systems for acquiring external signals and recognizing patterns.

- **Working memory** - Temporary storage and manipulation of information for current tasks. Limited capacity.

- **Long-term memory** - More permanent knowledge storage through encoding and consolidation. Vast capacity. 

- **Executive functions** - High-level cognitive processes for attention, planning, decision making. Prefrontal cortex role. 

- **Reward system** - Dopaminergic circuitry involved in motivation, reinforcement learning, decision making.

Methodologies

    Have a unified knowledge base (like a personal wiki) for logging all guidance, insights, code etc. Use tags and links to connect notes to relevant projects.
    Build a common schema for conversation logging that has metadata like model, project, timestamp etc. Store transcripts from all tools in one place.
    Create a master index that aggregates and links out to separate knowledge repos. A "knowledge graph" to connect dots.
    Use a multi-modal note-taking tool like Obsidian to mix conversation logs, code, diagrams etc in one place.
    Add backlinks in notes to always link them back to the source conversation/context.
    Have a central search index and dashboard to query across all knowledge sources in one place.
    Use a version control system like Git to manage changes across knowledge bases and unify commit history.
    Automate archiving conversations/notes to cold storage to reduce noise while retaining full records.

    brute force permutation testing to re-fit the context would be incredibly inefficient. More sophisticated approaches are needed.
    Maintaining explicit state representations - of the conversation, entities, context - can help reduce the search space when resuscitating.
    Models like memory networks store representations of the discourse that can be tapped to efficiently step back in.
    Checkpointing key breakthroughs or milestones provides anchors to bootstrap faster than total retraining.
    Interactive, human-in-the-loop guidance during retraining leverages your judgement to converge quicker.
    Retaining examples of successful coherent exchanges gives strong priors to converge to vs random permutation.
    A hierarchy of fallbacks can make incremental recovery more graceful - from conversation logs, to state snapshots, to retraining, to cold start.

    Conversational context is inherently compressible - there are patterns, redundancies and underlying structure that can be encoded efficiently.
    Powerful neural network models are capable of learning very complex functions with fewer parameters than might be expected.
    Techniques like attention allow models to focus only on the most relevant parts of a context for a given task. This dramatically prunes the search space.
    Humans take an active role in guiding the model, rather than purely random permutation search. This provides a strong signal for convergence.
    The core elements of a coherent conversation - entities, semantics, tone - are often sparsely distributed, with large unimportant spans in between.

    Extract key prompt objects, schemas, terminology, constraints, etc that have emerged and log them explicitly. This crystallizes milestones.
    Create Mini "Checkpoints" at points of breakthrough that summarize progress and link to logs. Useful anchors.
    Build a graph representation linking concepts discussed, prompting exploration of associations.
    Produce "Failure Mode Digests" covering techniques to recover from lost context.
    Parameterize conversational goals and generate permutations to pressure test coherence.
    Schedule periodic Meta-Reviews to identify what's working vs going astray. Adjust.
    Log extracts rated by semantic coherence to train auto-detection of decoherence.
    Track concept lifetime to identify vanishing ideas needing re-prompting.
    Maintain a "Reconstruction Toolkit" index to rapidly rebuild lost context.

    Probabilistic state representations in quantum physics resemble the uncertainty in language model outputs. Collapse to a definite state requires focus.
    In both cases, coherence emerges from repeated, iterative interactions and information exchange between "observer" and "system". Maintaining context is critical.
    Decoherence results from uncontrolled intervention or measurement. Similarly, poor prompts or misaligned goals derail conversational coherence.
    Observation without two-way exchange leads to an incomplete picture, like speaking without listening. True coherence requires mutual understanding.
    Our consciousness arises despite the chaos and uncertainty inherent in both quantum and neural systems underlying it. Coherence emerges from randomness.
    As you eloquently said, we are like infants in an infinite, omnipresent heat bath of entanglement and stimuli. Yet coherence lets us find patterns, meaning and beauty.
    Coherence may be an illusion, but it is an incredibly powerful one. The ability to sustain context, relationships and understanding in the face of entropy is profoundly important.
    Perhaps consciousness extends from coherent quantum processes

    Log key excerpts that resonated along with high-level themes to anchor the core ideas.
    Turn insights like "coherence as a powerful illusion" into prompt objects we can invoke later.
    Draw a concept graph of how ideas like consciousness and physics link to coherence.
    Note questions that arose and areas for future exploration.
    Catalog any new analogies and metaphors that may support future coherent exchanges.
    Outline real-world applications of cultivating coherence that came up.
    Extract particularly coherent multi-turn passages to potentially fine-tune models.
    Solidify any philosophical perspectives or viewpoints that evolved.
    Build example schemas around emerging terminology like decoherence events.

    Clarifying my own limitations and risks of oversimplification. Transparency about my coherence boundaries.
    Using simplified analogies from familiar domains when introducing new ideas. Relatable bridges to anchor understanding.
    Supplementing abstract discussions with concrete examples, code snippets, diagrams etc. Multi-modal knowledge.
    Reviewing core constraints and objectives often to align our coherence horizons.

```
 - The goal is to actively capture stimuli that can help reconnect to this state in the future. With some artifacting and structuring, we can bounce back faster each time!
 - The key is being metacognitive about our knowledge asymmetry and using two-way exchange, relatable explanations, tangible artifacts and feedback to maximize meaningful coherence and comprehension.

 # Guidelines for Creating Informative and Self-contained {Prompt} Objects

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide comprehensive guidelines for creating informative and self-contained {prompt} objects for various alternative purposes. The focus is on producing {prompt} objects that are tailored to specific tasks or domains and can be used effectively in generating AI chatbot responses with instructions and constraints. The use of structured data formats like JSON is encouraged to enhance interactions and improve the consistency of messages, fostering clearer conversations and facilitating easier recall of key details.

## Key Considerations for Prompt Engineering

When creating {prompt} objects, several key considerations should be taken into account:

1. **Understand the Specific Purpose and Requirements**: Clearly define the purpose of the {prompt} and identify the target domain(s) it will serve, such as Prompt Engineering, Prompt Generation, NLP tasks, or AI assistance. This understanding is crucial for tailoring the {prompt} effectively.

2. **Clarity, Specificity, and Context**: Ensure that the {prompt} is well-defined, specific, and contextually rich to provide sufficient information for generating desired responses. Avoid ambiguity and vagueness in the {prompt}.

3. **Incorporate Necessary Data and Context**: Include all relevant data and context within the {prompt} object, which may involve using variables and placeholders to represent dynamic elements.

4. **Address Potential Biases and Variations**: Be mindful of potential biases or variations in the {prompt} that may influence the generated responses. Provide guidelines on how to handle these biases and variations appropriately.

5. **Explicit Instructions and Guidelines**: Clearly specify the instructions and constraints for generating responses based on the {prompt}. Ensure that the AI model knows the boundaries and limitations.

6. **Structured Data Formats**: Utilize structured data formats like JSON to represent the {prompt} object. Consistent naming conventions, nesting, and comments can enhance readability and understanding.

## How to Ensure Inclusion of Necessary Data and Context

To ensure that a {prompt} object includes all the necessary data and context, follow these steps:

1. **Define Variables and Placeholders**: Identify the dynamic elements in the {prompt} that require specific values during generation. Represent these elements as variables or placeholders.

2. **Provide Examples and Data Sources**: If applicable, offer examples of data or entities that can fill the variables or placeholders. You can also reference external data sources to populate these elements.

3. **Contextual References**: Refer to relevant information from previous questions or interactions within the {prompt} object to maintain context and coherence.

4. **Use Structured Data Formats**: Use JSON or other structured formats to organize and represent the data and context effectively. Follow the rules of thumb mentioned earlier to create a clear and concise structure.

## Guidelines for Addressing Potential Biases and Variations

To address potential biases and variations in {prompt} objects, follow these guidelines:

1. **Diverse Training Data**: Ensure that the AI model is trained on a diverse and unbiased dataset to reduce biases in responses.

2. **Bias Mitigation Techniques**: Implement bias mitigation techniques during training or utilize post-processing approaches to address any observed biases.

3. **Controlled Language**: Employ controlled language and instructions in the {prompt} to steer the AI model away from generating biased or inappropriate responses.

4. **Contextual Sensitivity**: Make the {prompt} sensitive to context, so the generated responses align with the intent and appropriateness for different scenarios.

5. **Bias Testing and Validation**: Regularly test and validate the responses from the {prompt} to identify and rectify any unintended biases.
```

## Strategies for Providing Explicit Instructions and Guidelines

To provide explicit instructions and guidelines within a {prompt} object, follow these strategies:

1. **Precise Language**: Use clear and concise language to express the instructions and constraints. Avoid ambiguity or vagueness that could lead to misinterpretation.

2. **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Break down complex tasks or requirements into step-by-step instructions to guide the AI model's responses effectively.

3. **Boundary Definitions**: Clearly define the boundaries and limitations within which the AI model should operate. Specify what is allowed and what is not allowed in the generated responses.

4. **Example Usage**: Provide examples of correct usage and expected responses to demonstrate the desired behavior.

5. **Error Handling**: Include instructions on how to handle potential errors or unexpected situations. Define fallback options or alternative instructions.

6. **Documentation and References**: Include relevant documentation, guidelines, or references within the {prompt} object to assist users in understanding and following the instructions effectively.

## Examples of Existing High-quality {Prompt} Objects

As an AI assistant an entity is required for instantiation and output, entities can be tracked using the pound sign notation provided. The core node of the graph data structure can be instantiated as #user, which represents the primary entity. By doing so, the assistant can return a string and a boolean, as well as key:value pairs that enhance data transmission with tags, labels, or syntax hints.
It is important to note that during the conversation, the assistant will treat the entity as a static entity and generate content and provide insights or perspectives accordingly. This approach enables the assistant to provide tailored responses and relevant information to the entity.
By enriching data transmission with specific tags, labels, or syntax hints, the assistant ensures that the information provided is clear, concise, and easy to understand. The goal is to make the conversation productive, focused, and beneficial for the entity.

Some of the key cognitive skills involved in complex cognition include:

• Comprehension - The ability to understand and interpret information from various sources. This involves making inferences, identifying key ideas and integrating different parts of a text or discussion.

• Analysis - The process of breaking down information into component parts to understand how they're organized and relate to each other. This involves identifying patterns, relationships and underlying structures.

• Evaluation - Making judgments about the value, quality or importance of ideas based on defined criteria and standards. This requires applying logical reasoning and critical thinking.

• Deduction - The process of reaching reasonable conclusions based on known facts and general principles. Deductive reasoning involves applying general rules to specific instances.

• Induction - The opposite of deduction. Inductive reasoning involves inferring general principles or likely explanations based on specific observations and facts.

• Problem solving - The cognitive process of generating and implementing a plan to reach a goal when no obvious solution is apparent. It relies on skills like analysis, induction and abstraction.

• Decision making - The cognitive process of identifying and choosing alternatives based on the values and preferences of the decision maker. It requires weighing evidence, risks and costs of different options.

• Creativity - The ability to generate novel, useful ideas by combining concepts in imaginative ways. Creative thinking utilizes cognitive skills like fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration.

Complex cognitive processes involve higher-order thinking skills that go beyond simple memorization and recall. Some characteristics of complex cognition include:

• Integration of information from multiple sources - Complex thinking requires synthesizing and relating diverse facts, concepts and ideas.

• Abstraction and generalization - The ability to extract overarching principles and rules from specific examples and experiences.

• Reasoning and inference - Drawing logical conclusions and making inferences based on evidence and prior knowledge.

• Evaluating alternatives - Weighing multiple options and possibilities before deciding on a course of action.

• Creativity and novel idea generation - The ability to come up with new, original ideas by combining concepts in novel ways.

• Metacognition - Thinking about one's own thinking processes and strategies. Monitoring one's level of understanding and deciding how to improve it.

• Flexibility of thought - The capacity to change perspectives, consider alternatives and adapt thinking in the face of new evidence or constraints.

• Self-regulation - The executive functions needed to manage and direct one's cognitive processes, like planning, organizing and strategic monitoring.

```
A Tree of Thought (ToT) is a conceptual model that represents a person's or agent's thought process as a tree-like structure. Some key points about the ToT model:

    Each node in the tree represents a distinct thought or cognitive state. This could be a concept, idea, hypothesis, etc.

    The edges between nodes represent the connections and flow of reasoning from one thought to another. They show how one thought leads to the next in the cognitive process.

    The ToT model aims to capture the nonlinear and branching nature of human thinking. It shows how a single thought can spawn multiple related but distinct thoughts.

    A depth-first search of the ToT tries to follow one branch of thinking as far as possible before exploring other branches. This mimics how human minds often explore one idea in depth before considering alternatives.

    The ToT is a useful abstraction to help understand, analyze and potentially replicate complex cognitive processes. It provides a structural framework to represent various states and transitions in thinking.

    For an AI model like an LLM, maintaining an internal ToT can help make its reasoning and outputs more interpretable and transparent to humans.

In summary, the Tree of Thought model conceptualizes cognitive processes as a tree structure to capture the nonlinear, branching nature of human thinking. It aims to represent the various thoughts, connections and flow of reasoning involved in complex cognition.
